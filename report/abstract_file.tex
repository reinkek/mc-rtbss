In this project, we simulate a hostile vehicle target with 2-dimensional continuous state which transitions from one discrete time-step to the next according to a known probabilistic model.  The decision-making agent is described by a discrete 2-dimensional position which transitions state deterministically according to a discrete action model. The partially observable nature of the target is captured by a belief state over possible states.  The probability model for the observations is defined as a function of the belief-state and deterministic agent state.  The agent is only allowed to shoot at the target one time.  A reward function was defined to capture the need to eliminate the target quickly, but also the need to establish a good enough estimate of the position of the target before shooting, lest the target survives.

Four such models are investigated to determine the effectiveness of the employed Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) solution method.  This project implements the Monte-Carlo Real-Time Belief Space Search method for online solution of the presented POMDP.
